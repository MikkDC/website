<h2 class="zeroMargin">Why Trophy Hunt?</h2>

<p>There are many reasons why people hunt trophies. Here are just some of the many reasons.</p>

<h3 class="zeroMargin"><B>Community</B></h3>
<p>Trophy Hunting communities are some of the best communities you can find when it comes to gaming. Trophy Hunting communities are focused around helping each other, giving tips and advice and are generally a really nice place to be. Click the links below to check out Some of the best ones.

      </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="zeroMargin"><B>Game Appreciation</B></h3>
<p>It's a great way to show your appreciation for a game or even a game series. Some players like to go for the Platinum trophy in all the games of a series, others just go for the games they really enjoy. Either way, it shows that you want to do that little bit extra and do the little tasks the game developers decided would be worth a trophy. Which brings me on to the next reason.
</p>

<h3 class="zeroMargin"><B>Get More From Your Games</B></h3>
<p>Videogames for the most part, aren't cheap, so it's only natural you want to get the most bang for buck out of your games. For games I REALLY enjoy, going for the Platinum is a way to extend the life of a game by approaching it in a different way or doing challenges set by the developers and side quests you may other wise have just ignored. An example of this is The Witcher 3, which has some of the best side quests in any game, ever.
