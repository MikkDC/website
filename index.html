<p class="zeroMargin"> The short and simple answer is: They're fun!</p>

<p class="zeroMargin">The real question is: <em>Why</em> are they fun?</p>

<p class="zeroMargin">For me, gaming is a hobby I enjoy for many reasons.</p>

<p class="zeroMargin">Sometimes it's just to relax, sometimes I game for a challenge, other times I game to experience a great story, or just to escape the stresses of real life for a few hours.</p>

<p class="zeroMargin">Games I <strong>really</strong> enjoy, I will take on the challenge of trying to achieve everything within that game, and on PlayStation this means attempting to get the Platinum trophy. You can see more about this on the <a href="trophy.html">Trophy Hunting</a> page.</p>

<p class="zeroMargin">The stories in some games are so good they get you emotionally invested in them so much that it's the story alone which keeps you coming back for more. Kind of like binge watching a TV show which hooks you, except you end up playing the game for hours and wonder where the time has gone!</p>

<p class="zeroMargin">But for me, the best thing about gaming is the escapism, the immersion, the worlds you can get lost in and the characters you can meet. They let you escape the stresses of real life and become someone or something completely different for a few hours.</p>
