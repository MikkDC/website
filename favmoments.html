    <div class="ltblue textbox centerbox">
<p>Here are some of my favourite moments in gaming from the past 10 years. There are many more moments which stand out that I could mention, such as the "Would You Kindly?" twist from Bioshock and the entire Bloody Baron questline in The Witcher 3 but both of those have been covered countless times by others, so here I choose to show some more personal favourites.
    <ul>
        <li><i><b>Final Fantasy XV</b></i> - Driving across the entire map because sometimes you just have to stop and take it all in.</li> 
        <li><i><b>Elite Dangerous</b></i> - Finding a 'feeding' Thargoid. They are both frightening and magnificent at the same time!</li> 
        <li><i><b>Dragon Age: Inquisition</b></i> - A very strange event which took me completely by surprise when I first saw it. </li>
        <li><i><b>Alien: isolation</b></i> - This is a compilation of close calls I had with the Xenomorph while playing.</li></ul>
